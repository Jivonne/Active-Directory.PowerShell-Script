# Adding Users to Active Directory with PowerShell üöÄ

This guide explains how to use the provided PowerShell script to efficiently create multiple user accounts in Active Directory on a Windows Server 2019 environment.

## Prerequisites üìã

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A Windows Server 2019 instance with Active Directory Domain Services installed and configured.
* Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) for Active Directory Domain Services installed on the machine where you'll run the script (if not running directly on the domain controller).
* A user account with sufficient permissions to create new users in Active Directory.
* The provided PowerShell script (`PS script.txt`).

## Step-by-Step Guide ü™ú

### Step 1: Save the PowerShell Script üíæ

1.  Open a new text file and copy the entire content of the provided `PS script.txt` into it.
2.  Save the file with a `.ps1` extension (e.g., `Add-ADUsers.ps1`).

### Step 2: Modify Script Variables ‚úèÔ∏è

Open the `Add-ADUsers.ps1` file in a text editor (like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code) and modify the following variables at the beginning of the script to suit your needs:

* `$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS`: Set this to the desired password for the new user accounts. For example:
    ```powershell
    $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS = "YourSecurePassword123!"
    ```
* `$NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS_TO_CREATE`: Specify the total number of user accounts you wish to create. For example, to create 500 users:
    ```powershell
    $NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS_TO_CREATE = 500
    ```

### Step 3: Understand the Script's Functionality üí°

The script performs the following actions:

* [cite_start]**Generates Random Names**: It includes a `generate-random-name` function that creates random first and last names for the users. 
* [cite_start]**Constructs Username**: It combines the generated first and last names to form a username in the format `firstName.lastName`. 
* [cite_start]**Sets Password**: It sets the password for all created users to the value specified in `$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS`. 
* [cite_start]**Creates Users in AD**: For each user, it utilizes the `New-ADUser` cmdlet to create the account in Active Directory. 
    * [cite_start]`AccountPassword`: Sets the user's password. 
    * [cite_start]`GivenName`: Sets the user's first name. 
    * [cite_start]`Surname`: Sets the user's last name. 
    * [cite_start]`DisplayName`: Sets the user's display name, which is the same as the username in this script. 
    * [cite_start]`Name`: Sets the user's full name in Active Directory. 
    * [cite_start]`EmployeeID`: Sets the employee ID to the username. 
    * [cite_start]`PasswordNeverExpires`: Configures the password to never expire for these accounts. 
    * `Path`: Specifies the Organizational Unit (OU) where the new users will be created. By default, it's set to `ou=_EMPLOYEES`. [cite_start]**Ensure this OU exists in your Active Directory or modify the path to an existing OU.** 
    * [cite_start]`Enabled`: Enables the user account immediately upon creation. 

### Step 4: Run the PowerShell Script ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  Open PowerShell as an Administrator on your Active Directory server or a machine with RSAT installed and configured to manage your domain.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the `Add-ADUsers.ps1` script. For example:
    ```powershell
    cd C:\Scripts
    ```
3.  Execute the script using the following command:
    ```powershell
    .\Add-ADUsers.ps1
    ```

### Step 5: Verify User Creation ‚úÖ

After the script completes, you can verify the creation of the new user accounts by:

* Opening **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
* Navigating to the OU specified in the script (e.g., `_EMPLOYEES`).
* You should see the newly created user accounts listed there.

## Important Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

* **Password Policy**: Ensure the password you set in `$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS` complies with your Active Directory password policy. If it doesn't, user creation will fail.
* **Organizational Unit (OU)**: The script attempts to create users in an OU named `_EMPLOYEES`. If this OU does not exist, you will need to:
    * Create the `_EMPLOYEES` OU manually in Active Directory Users and Computers, OR
    * Modify the `-Path` parameter in the `New-ADUser` cmdlet within the script to an existing OU in your environment.
* **Permissions**: The account running the script must have the necessary permissions to create user objects within the specified OU in Active Directory.
* **Testing**: It's highly recommended to test the script with a small number of users in a test environment before running it to create a large number of accounts in a production environment.
* **Error Handling**: For production environments, consider adding more robust error handling to the script to log failures or issues during user creation.
