# Creating a Dedicated Domain Administrator Account on Windows Server 2019 (in VMware) 💻

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a dedicated domain administrator account on a Windows Server 2019 instance running within a VMware virtual machine. This is a crucial security practice to avoid using the built-in "Administrator" account for daily administrative tasks.

## 1. Prerequisites ✅

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **VMware Workstation/Player/ESXi**: A working VMware environment.
* **Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machine**: A VM with Windows Server 2019 installed and configured as a Domain Controller (Active Directory Domain Services installed and promoted).
* **Administrative Access**: You must be logged in to the Windows Server 2019 VM with an account that has existing Domain Admin privileges (e.g., the built-in Administrator account used during AD DS promotion).
* **Network Connectivity**: The VM should have network connectivity to other machines in the domain (if applicable).

## 2. Verify VM Network Configuration 🌐

Ensure your Windows Server 2019 VM is correctly configured on the network and can communicate within your domain.

1.  **Check Network Adapter**: In your VMware software, ensure the network adapter for the Server 2019 VM is set to `Bridged` (if connecting directly to your physical network) or `NAT` (if using VMware's NAT service) and can reach your domain's DNS.
2.  **Verify Domain Join**: Confirm the server is a Domain Controller. You can do this by opening Server Manager and checking the roles, or by running:
    ```powershell
    (Get-ComputerInfo).CsDomainRole
    ```
    It should return a value like `PrimaryDomainController`.

## 3. Access Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) 🖥️

This is the primary tool for managing users and groups in Active Directory.

1.  **Login**: Log in to your Windows Server 2019 VM using an existing Domain Administrator account.
2.  **Open Server Manager**:
    * Click the **Start** button.
    * Click **Server Manager**.
3.  **Navigate to ADUC**:
    * In Server Manager, click **Tools** in the top right corner.
    * Select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    *(Alternatively, you can press `Win + R`, type `dsa.msc`, and press Enter.)*

## 4. Create a New User Account 🧑‍💻

We will now create the new user account that will become your dedicated domain admin.

1.  **Navigate to Users or OU**: In the **Active Directory Users and Computers** window:
    * Expand your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.local`).
    * Right-click on the **Users** container (or a specific Organizational Unit (OU) where you prefer to place administrative accounts).
    * Select `New` > `User`.

2.  **Fill in User Information**: In the "New Object - User" dialog box:
    * **First name**: `Dedicated`
    * **Last name**: `Admin`
    * **Full name**: `Dedicated Admin` (This will auto-populate)
    * **User logon name**: Choose a descriptive and secure username, e.g., `d.admin` or `srvadmin`. This will be the username for logging in.
    * Click `Next`.

3.  **Set Password**:
    * **Password**: Enter a strong, complex password.
    * **Confirm password**: Re-enter the password.
    * **Uncheck `User must change password at next logon`**: For an admin account, it's often better to set a known strong password immediately.
    * **Check `Password never expires`**: For service accounts or dedicated admin accounts, this is common, but ensure your organization's policy allows it.
    * **Check `Account is disabled`**: (Optional, but recommended for security) You can enable it after confirming its setup.
    * Click `Next`.

4.  **Finish**: Review the summary and click `Finish` to create the user account.

## 5. Add the User to the Domain Admins Group ➕

This is the crucial step that grants the new user domain administrator privileges.

1.  **Locate the New User**: In **Active Directory Users and Computers**, find the user account you just created.
2.  **Open User Properties**: Right-click on the new user account (e.g., `Dedicated Admin`) and select `Properties`.
3.  **Go to Member Of Tab**: In the user's properties window, click on the `Member Of` tab.
4.  **Add to Domain Admins**:
    * Click the `Add...` button.
    * In the "Select Groups" dialog box, type `Domain Admins`.
    * Click `Check Names`. It should resolve to `Domain Admins` (and underline it).
    * Click `OK`.
    * You should now see `Domain Admins` listed under the "Member Of" tab.
    * Click `OK` to close the user properties.

5.  **(Optional) Enable the Account**: If you disabled the account during creation (Step 4.3), right-click the user account, and select `Enable Account`.

## 6. Test the New Domain Administrator Account ✅

It's important to verify that the new account has the correct permissions.

1.  **Log Off Current Session**: Log off from your current administrative session on the Windows Server 2019 VM.
2.  **Log In with New Account**: Attempt to log in to the Windows Server 2019 VM (or any domain-joined machine) using the newly created username (e.g., `yourdomain\d.admin` or `d.admin@yourdomain.local`) and the password you set.
3.  **Verify Administrative Privileges**: Once logged in with the new account:
    * Try opening **Active Directory Users and Computers** or **Group Policy Management**.
    * Attempt to create a new user or modify a group. If you can perform these actions, the account has been successfully granted Domain Admin privileges.

## 7. Important Security Notes 🔒

* **Principle of Least Privilege**: While this guide creates a dedicated domain admin, in a production environment, always strive to follow the "Principle of Least Privilege." This means granting users only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, and nothing more. For day-to-day tasks, consider using separate accounts with fewer privileges.
* **Secure Passwords**: Always use strong, unique passwords for administrative accounts.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: For highly sensitive accounts like domain administrators, implement Multi-Factor Authentication if your environment supports it.
* **Audit Logging**: Regularly review security logs for suspicious activity related to administrative accounts.
* **Do Not Use Built-in Administrator**: After creating and testing your dedicated domain admin account, it is highly recommended to disable or rename the built-in "Administrator" account to make it harder for attackers to target.
