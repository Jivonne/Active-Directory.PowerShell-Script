# 🚀 Setting up Internal and External NICs on Active Directory Server 2019

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring two Network Interface Cards (**NICs**) on a **Windows Server 2019** virtual machine running Active Directory. One NIC will be set up for **external network access** (internet, other lab VMs) 🌐 and the other for **internal, isolated communication** within your lab environment 🔒. This setup is perfect for home labs where you want to simulate real-world network segmentation and control.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

* **VMware Workstation Pro** or **VMware Workstation Player** installed. 💻
* A **Windows Server 2019 ISO image**. 💿
* A **newly created or existing Windows Server 2019 virtual machine** with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed (or ready for installation). 🖥️
* A basic understanding of networking concepts like IP addresses, subnets, and DNS. 🧠

---

## 🗺️ Network Design Overview

We'll be implementing a setup like this:

* **External NIC: 🌐 (Internet/Home Network)**
    * **Purpose:** Internet access, communication with other VMs on your home network.
    * **VMware Network Type:** **Bridged** or **NAT** (Bridged is recommended for direct network access).
    * **IP Addressing:** DHCP from your home router, or a static IP within your home network's subnet.
* **Internal NIC: 🔒 (Isolated Lab Network)**
    * **Purpose:** Isolated communication with other lab VMs (e.g., client machines joined to your domain).
    * **VMware Network Type:** **Host-only** or **Custom** (to a dedicated private VMnet).
    * **IP Addressing:** Static IP address within a private, non-routable subnet (e.g., `192.168.10.0/24`).
    * **DNS:** This NIC will primarily point to itself (or other domain controllers) for DNS resolution within the internal network.

## 💻 VMware Configuration

### Adding Network Adapters ➕

1.  **Shut down** your Windows Server 2019 virtual machine. 🛑
2.  Open **VMware Workstation/Player**.
3.  Select your Windows Server 2019 VM and click **"Edit virtual machine settings"**. ⚙️
4.  In the "Hardware" tab, click **"Add..."**.
5.  Select **"Network Adapter"** and click **"Finish"**.
6.  For the **first new network adapter** (this will be your **External NIC**):
    * Choose **"Bridged (Automatic)"** or **"NAT"**. Bridged is generally preferred for direct access to your home network and the internet.
    * Make sure "Connect at power on" is checked. ✅
7.  Click **"Add..."** again.
8.  Select **"Network Adapter"** and click **"Finish"**.
9.  For the **second new network adapter** (this will be your **Internal NIC**):
    * Choose **"Host-only"** or **"Custom: Specific virtual network"**.
    * If you pick "Custom", select a dedicated VMnet (e.g., VMnet2, VMnet3) that you'll define as an isolated network. We'll cover this in the next section.
    * Make sure "Connect at power on" is checked. ✅
10. Click **"OK"** to save the VM settings. 👍

### VMware Network Editor (Optional but Recommended) 🌐🔧

This step is crucial if you want a truly isolated internal network or if you chose "Custom" for your internal NIC.

1.  From the VMware Workstation menu, go to **"Edit" > "Virtual Network Editor..."**. 🛠️
2.  You'll see a list of VMnets:
    * **VMnet0 (Bridged):** Typically used for your external NIC.
    * **VMnet1 (Host-only):** Often used for host-only communication.
    * **VMnet8 (NAT):** Often used for NAT.
3.  If you want to create a new, isolated network for your internal NIC (e.g., `VMnet2`):
    * Click **"Add Network..."**.
    * Select an available VMnet (e.g., `VMnet2`) and click **"OK"**.
    * Select the newly added `VMnet2`.
    * **Uncheck "Connect a host virtual adapter to this network."** (This stops your physical host from being on this network, making it truly isolated for VMs). 🚫
    * **Uncheck "Use local DHCP service to distribute IP addresses to VMs."** (Your Active Directory server will handle DHCP for this internal network). 🚫
    * Define the **Subnet IP** (e.g., `192.168.10.0`) and **Subnet mask** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
    * Click **"Apply"** then **"OK"**.
4.  If you've just created a new VMnet for your internal NIC, go back to your VM settings, select the internal network adapter, and change its network type to **"Custom"** and select the VMnet you just configured (e.g., `VMnet2`).

## ⚙️ Windows Server 2019 Network Configuration

Now, power on your Windows Server 2019 virtual machine. 🚀

### Identifying NICs 🤔

It's important to figure out which network adapter in Windows corresponds to which VMware network type.

1.  Open **Server Manager**. 📊
2.  Go to **"Local Server"**.
3.  Click on **"Ethernet"** (or "Wired Ethernet Connection") next to "Wired Connection". This will open "Network Connections". 🔗
4.  You'll see multiple "Ethernet" connections. To identify them:
    * **Disable one NIC at a time in Windows and see which one disconnects in VMware's VM settings** (under "Network Adapter" details). This is a reliable method. 🕵️‍♂️
    * Alternatively, you might look at the connection status: the one with internet access is likely your external NIC, and the one with "Unidentified Network" is likely your internal NIC.
    * Once identified, **rename them for clarity** (e.g., "External NIC" and "Internal NIC"). Just right-click the adapter and select "Rename". ✏️

### Configuring the External NIC 🌐

This NIC will get internet access and communicate with your broader home network.

1.  Right-click your **"External NIC"** (the one connected to Bridged or NAT) and select **"Properties"**. 📃
2.  Select **"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)"** and click **"Properties"**.
3.  **Recommended for Home Labs (DHCP):**
    * Choose **"Obtain an IP address automatically"**. 📡
    * Choose **"Obtain DNS server address automatically"**.
    * This lets your router assign an IP and DNS.
4.  **Alternatively (Static IP):**
    * Select **"Use the following IP address:"**
    * Enter an **IP address** that's within your home network's subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.50`). 🔢
    * Enter the **Subnet mask** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
    * Enter the **Default gateway** (your home router's IP address, e.g., `192.168.1.1`). 🚪
    * For **Preferred DNS server**, you can initially point it to your home router or a public DNS server (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).
    * For **Alternate DNS server**, you can leave it blank or use another public DNS server (e.g., `8.8.4.4`).
5.  Click **"OK"** twice. ✅

### Configuring the Internal NIC 🔒

This NIC will be used for your isolated lab network, including DNS for Active Directory clients.

1.  Right-click your **"Internal NIC"** (the one connected to Host-only or your custom VMnet) and select **"Properties"**. 📃
2.  Select **"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)"** and click **"Properties"**.
3.  Select **"Use the following IP address:"**
    * **IP address:** Assign a static IP address within your chosen internal subnet. This will be the IP address for your Active Directory server on the internal network. For example, if your internal VMnet is `192.168.10.0/24`, use `192.168.10.1` (or another available IP, but `*.1` is common for the DC). 🔢
    * **Subnet mask:** `255.255.255.0` (or as defined by your VMnet).
    * **Default gateway:** Leave this blank or point it to itself (`192.168.10.1`) if this is the only router in the isolated network and it also acts as a gateway (which it won't be for external traffic in this isolated setup). For a simple AD lab, leaving it blank is fine for this internal NIC. 🚫
    * **Preferred DNS server:** This is **crucial for Active Directory**. Point it to the **IP address of this internal NIC itself** (e.g., `192.168.10.1`). This makes your Active Directory server its own primary DNS server. 🎯
    * **Alternate DNS server:** If you have multiple Domain Controllers, you'd put the IP of the other DC here. For a single DC, you can leave it blank or use the loopback address (`127.0.0.1`).
4.  Click **"OK"** twice. ✅

## 🌳 Active Directory Considerations

* Make sure your Active Directory Domain Services are properly installed and configured on this server. 🔑
* The **DNS server role** should be installed on this server and configured to host your domain's DNS zones. 🖥️
* Ensure the **DNS settings on your internal NIC** correctly point to the Active Directory server's internal IP address. 🔗
* If you plan to have client machines join the domain, they'll need to be configured with an IP address on the internal network (e.g., `192.168.10.x`) and have their primary DNS server set to the internal IP of your Active Directory server (e.g., `192.168.10.1`). 🤝

---

## ✅ Verification

After configuring both NICs:

1.  **Test External NIC:** 🌐
    * Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
    * Run `ipconfig /all` to verify the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers for your external NIC.
    * `ping google.com` to verify internet connectivity. 🟢
    * `nslookup google.com` to verify external DNS resolution. 🔎
2.  **Test Internal NIC:** 🔒
    * Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
    * Run `ipconfig /all` to verify the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS servers for your internal NIC.
    * From a client VM on the *same internal VMnet*, try to `ping` the internal IP of your AD server (e.g., `ping 192.168.10.1`). 🟢
    * From a client VM, try to `nslookup yourdomain.local` (replace `yourdomain.local` with your actual domain name) and ensure it resolves to your AD server's internal IP. 🔎
3.  **Active Directory Functionality:** 🌳
    * Ensure Active Directory users and computers can be accessed.
    * Verify Group Policy application.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

* **No Internet on External NIC:** ❌
    * Check VMware's network adapter settings for the external NIC (Bridged vs. NAT).
    * Verify IP configuration (IP, subnet, gateway, DNS) in Windows matches your home network.
    * Check your home router's DHCP lease or IP address availability if you're using static.
    * Temporarily disable Windows Firewall to see if it's blocking traffic (remember to re-enable and configure rules if it helps). 🚧
* **No Connectivity on Internal NIC:** ⛔
    * Verify the internal NIC is connected to the correct VMnet in VMware settings.
    * Ensure the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server are correctly configured in Windows.
    * Confirm the VMnet in "Virtual Network Editor" is configured as isolated (no host adapter, no DHCP).
    * Check for IP address conflicts if you have other VMs on the same internal VMnet.
* **Active Directory/DNS Issues:** 🛑
    * Make sure the Preferred DNS server on the internal NIC points to the AD server itself.
    * Verify the DNS server role is running and your domain's forward lookup zone is present.
    * Check DNS event logs for errors.
    * Run `dcdiag /test:dns` in an elevated command prompt on the DC.
* **Firewall:** Windows Firewall can sometimes block legitimate Active Directory traffic. Ensure the necessary firewall rules are in place for AD DS and DNS, or temporarily disable it for testing (but re-enable and configure properly for security). 🛡️
