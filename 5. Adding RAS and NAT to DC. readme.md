# Step-by-Step Guide: Installing RAS/NAT on Active Directory Server 2019 in VMware

This guide outlines the process of installing and configuring Remote Access Server (RAS) with Network Address Translation (NAT) on a Windows Server 2019 Active Directory (AD) server, running as a virtual machine within VMware. This setup allows your internal network to access external resources (like the internet) through the AD server, which acts as a router and NAT device. 🌐

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **VMware Workstation or ESXi:** A working VMware environment. 💻
* **Windows Server 2019 ISO:** The installation media for Windows Server 2019. 💿
* **Active Directory Domain Controller:** A pre-existing Windows Server 2019 VM configured as an Active Directory Domain Controller. 👑
* **Two Network Adapters for the AD Server VM:**
    * One adapter connected to your **internal network** (e.g., a custom VMnet in VMware for your AD domain). This adapter will typically have a static IP address within your internal subnet. 🏠
    * One adapter connected to an **external network** (e.g., `NAT` or `Bridged` in VMware, depending on your setup, to access the internet). This adapter will obtain an IP address from your external network (either via DHCP or a static public/routable IP if applicable). 🌍
* **Administrative Privileges:** You must be logged in as a domain administrator or an account with equivalent privileges on the AD server. 🔑

## Step 1: Configure Network Adapters in VMware

1.  **Shut down** your Windows Server 2019 Active Directory VM. 🛑
2.  **Edit the Virtual Machine Settings:** Right-click the VM in VMware and select "Settings" or "Edit virtual machine settings." ⚙️
3.  **Add a Second Network Adapter:**
    * Click "Add..."➕
    * Select "Network Adapter" and click "Finish." ✅
4.  **Configure Network Adapter 1 (Internal):**
    * Ensure this adapter is connected to your **internal VMnet** (e.g., `VMnet1 (Host-only)` or a custom `VMnet` you've created for your internal network). 🏘️
    * Note down the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server (which should point to your AD server's internal IP) for your internal network. 📝
5.  **Configure Network Adapter 2 (External):**
    * Connect this adapter to the network that provides **internet access**. 🌐
        * **For typical home labs:** Select `NAT` (VMware's built-in NAT, which allows the VM to share the host's IP for internet access) or `Bridged` (the VM gets an IP directly from your physical network). `NAT` is often simpler for this setup. 🏡
        * **For production environments:** This adapter would be connected to a network segment that provides external connectivity. 🏢
6.  **Power on** your Windows Server 2019 Active Directory VM. 🚀

## Step 2: Install the Remote Access Role

1.  **Log in** to your Windows Server 2019 AD server with administrative privileges. 🚪
2.  Open **Server Manager**. 🖥️
3.  Click **"Add Roles and Features"**. ➕
4.  Click **"Next"** on the "Before you begin" page. ▶️
5.  Select **"Role-based or feature-based installation"** and click **"Next"**. ✅
6.  Ensure your AD server is selected under **"Select a server from the server pool"** and click **"Next"**. ➡️
7.  In the "Select server roles" section, check the box next to **"Remote Access"**. 📦
8.  A dialog box will appear asking to add required features. Click **"Add Features"**. 👍
9.  Click **"Next"**. ▶️
10. On the "Select features" page, click **"Next"**. (No additional features are typically needed for basic NAT). ➡️
11. On the "Remote Access" page, click **"Next"**. ▶️
12. Select **"DirectAccess and VPN (RAS)"** and **"Routing"**. (Do NOT select "Web Application Proxy" for this scenario). 🔄
13. A dialog box will appear asking to add required features. Click **"Add Features"**. 👍
14. Click **"Next"**. ▶️
15. On the "Web Server Role (IIS)" page, click **"Next"**. (IIS is installed as a dependency for DirectAccess, even if not fully utilized for basic NAT). 🌐
16. On the "Select role services" page for IIS, click **"Next"**. ➡️
17. On the "Confirmation" page, review your selections. Check **"Restart the destination server automatically if required"** (this is usually not required for this role, but good practice). 🔄
18. Click **"Install"**. ⏳
19. Once the installation is complete, click **"Close"**. ✅

## Step 3: Configure Network Address Translation (NAT)

1.  In **Server Manager**, click the **"Notifications"** flag (top right corner). 🔔
2.  Click **"Open the Getting Started Wizard"** for Remote Access. ✨
3.  Select **"Deploy VPN only"**. (Even though we're setting up NAT, this wizard is the starting point for configuring routing). 🔑
4.  This will open the **"Routing and Remote Access"** console. 🗺️
5.  In the "Routing and Remote Access" console, right-click on your server's name (e.g., `YOURSERVERNAME (local)`) and select **"Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access"**. ⚙️
6.  Click **"Next"** on the "Welcome" page. ▶️
7.  On the "Configuration" page, select **"Network address translation (NAT)"** and click **"Next"**. ➡️
8.  On the "Internet Connection" page, select the network adapter that is connected to your **external network** (the one providing internet access). This is crucial for NAT to function correctly. Click **"Next"**. 🌍
9.  On the "Services and Ports" page, you can optionally configure specific ports for NAT if needed. For basic internet access, you can leave the default settings. Click **"Next"**. 🌐
10. Click **"Finish"** to complete the wizard. ✅
11. Routing and Remote Access will now start the service. You should see a green arrow next to your server name in the console, indicating the service is running. ▶️🟢

## Step 4: Verify NAT Configuration

1.  In the "Routing and Remote Access" console, expand your server name. ➕
2.  Expand **"IPv4"**. ➕
3.  Click on **"NAT"**. 🔍
4.  You should see your external network interface listed under "NAT Interfaces." Right-click on it and select **"Properties"**. ℹ️
5.  Under the "General" tab, ensure **"Public interface connected to the Internet"** and **"Enable NAT on this interface"** are checked. ✅
6.  You can also review the "Address Pool" and "Services and Ports" tabs for advanced configurations if needed. Click **"OK"**. 👍

## Step 5: Configure Internal Network Clients (DNS and Gateway)

For your internal network clients (other VMs on your internal VMnet) to access the internet through your AD/NAT server, you need to configure their network settings:

1.  **Primary DNS Server:** All internal clients should have their primary DNS server set to the **internal IP address of your Active Directory server**. 🎯
2.  **Default Gateway:** All internal clients should have their default gateway set to the **internal IP address of your Active Directory server**. 🛣️

**Example:**

If your AD server's internal IP is `192.168.1.1`:

* **DNS:** `192.168.1.1` ➡️
* **Gateway:** `192.168.1.1` ➡️

You can configure these settings manually on each client or, more efficiently, through **DHCP Scope Options** on your Active Directory server if it's also running the DHCP role. 💡

## Step 6: Test Connectivity

1.  From an internal client VM connected to your internal network, open a command prompt. 💻
2.  Try to ping an external website: `ping google.com` 🌐
3.  Try to browse to an external website using a web browser. 🧑‍💻

If everything is configured correctly, your internal clients should now be able to access the internet through your Windows Server 2019 Active Directory server, which is acting as a NAT router. 🎉

## Troubleshooting

* **Firewall:** Ensure Windows Firewall on the AD server is not blocking necessary traffic. By default, RAS/NAT installation configures firewall rules, but custom rules might interfere. 🔥
* **IP Addresses:** Double-check all IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways on both the AD server's network adapters and your internal client VMs. 🔢
* **VMware Network Settings:** Verify your VMware VMnet configurations for both internal and external adapters are correct. 🔌
* **Routing and Remote Access Service:** Ensure the "Routing and Remote Access" service is running on your AD server. 🟢
* **DNS Resolution:** If clients can ping external IPs but not hostnames, there might be an issue with DNS resolution. Ensure your AD server's internal IP is set as the primary DNS for clients and that the AD server itself can resolve external DNS queries. ❓
