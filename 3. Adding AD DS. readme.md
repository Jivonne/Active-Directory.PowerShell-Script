## âž• Step 1: Install Active Directory Domain Services Role

Now, you'll add the AD DS role to your server.

1.  **Open Server Manager:**
    * From the `Start` menu, search for and open `Server Manager`.
2.  **Add Roles and Features:**
    * In Server Manager, click `Manage` > `Add Roles and Features`.
    * Click `Next` on the "Before You Begin" page.
    * Select `Role-based or feature-based installation` and click `Next`.
    * Ensure your server is selected under "Server Selection" and click `Next`.
3.  **Select Active Directory Domain Services:**
    * On the "Server Roles" page, check the box next to `Active Directory Domain Services`.
    * A dialog box will appear asking to add required features. Click `Add Features`.
    * Click `Next`.
4.  **Confirm Installation Selections:**
    * On the "Features" page, click `Next`.
    * On the "Active Directory Domain Services" page, review the information and click `Next`.
    * On the "Confirmation" page, review the selections. You can optionally check `Restart the destination server automatically if required`.
    * Click `Install`.

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell equivalent to install AD-Domain-Services
    Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
    ```

5.  **Wait for Installation:**
    * The installation process will begin. This may take a few minutes.
    * Once the installation is complete, click `Close`.

## ðŸ‘‘ Step 2: Promote the Server to a Domain Controller

Installing the role is only the first part. You now need to promote the server to become a domain controller.

1.  **Promote This Server to a Domain Controller:**
    * After the AD DS role installation, a notification flag (yellow exclamation mark) will appear in Server Manager.
    * Click the flag and then click `Promote this server to a domain controller`.
2.  **Deployment Configuration:**
    * In the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard, select `Add a new forest`.
    * Enter your desired **Root domain name** (e.g., `yourdomain.local`). This is your new domain.
    * Click `Next`.

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell equivalent to promote a new forest (example)
    Install-ADDSDomainController `
    -CreateDC 'NewForest' `
    -DomainName 'yourdomain.local' `
    -DomainNetbiosName 'YOURDOMAIN' `
    -InstallDns 'True' `
    -NoRebootOnCompletion:$false `
    -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString "Enter DSRM password")
    ```

3.  **Domain Controller Options:**
    * **Functional Levels:** The Forest functional level and Domain functional level will default to Windows Server 2016 for Server 2019. Leave these as default unless you have specific compatibility requirements.
    * **DNS Server:** Ensure `Domain Name System (DNS) server` is checked.
    * **Global Catalog (GC):** Ensure `Global Catalog (GC)` is checked.
    * **Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) Password:** Enter and confirm a strong password for DSRM. This password is critical for restoring Active Directory in case of issues. **Remember this password!**
    * Click `Next`.
4.  **DNS Options:**
    * You might see a warning about a DNS delegation not being created. This is normal for a new forest. Click `Next`.
5.  **Additional Options:**
    * The NetBIOS domain name will be automatically populated based on your domain name. Click `Next`.
6.  **Paths:**
    * Leave the default paths for the AD DS database, log files, and SYSVOL folder unless you have specific storage requirements. Click `Next`.
7.  **Review Options:**
    * Review your selections. You can click `View Script` to see the PowerShell commands that will be executed.
    * Click `Next`.
8.  **Prerequisites Check:**
    * The wizard will perform a prerequisite check. Address any critical errors. Warnings are often informational and can be ignored for a lab environment.
    * Click `Install`.
9.  **Installation and Reboot:**
    * The installation process will begin, and the server will automatically reboot upon completion.

## âœ… Step 3: Verify AD DS Installation

After the server reboots and you log in, verify that Active Directory is successfully installed.

1.  **Log in to the Domain:**
    * The login screen should now show your domain (e.g., `YOURDOMAIN\Administrator` or `yourdomain\Administrator`). Log in with your administrator credentials.
2.  **Open Server Manager:**
    * Verify that `AD DS` and `DNS` roles are listed in Server Manager.
3.  **Access Active Directory Tools:**
    * In Server Manager, click `Tools`.
    * You should now see various Active Directory administrative tools, such as:
        * `Active Directory Administrative Center`
        * `Active Directory Users and Computers`
        * `Active Directory Sites and Services`
        * `DNS`
        * `Group Policy Management`

    * Open `Active Directory Users and Computers` to confirm that your domain is created and accessible.

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell to check AD DS role status
    Get-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services | Select-Object Name,DisplayName,InstallState
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell to check if the server is a Domain Controller
    (Get-ADForest).Domains | ForEach-Object { Get-ADDomainController -Server $_.Name }
    ```
