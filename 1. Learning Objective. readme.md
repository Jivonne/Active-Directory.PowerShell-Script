## Learning Objectives: Setting up Active Directory on VMware

This repository outlines the learning objectives for a hands-on project focused on deploying and configuring an Active Directory Domain Controller within a VMware virtualized environment. This project covers essential steps from virtual machine creation and network setup to Active Directory installation, network services configuration, and bulk user provisioning.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to establish a functional Active Directory domain within a virtual lab, providing a foundational understanding of core Windows Server and networking concepts crucial for IT infrastructure management.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will be able to:

1.  **Virtual Machine Provisioning with VMware:** üíª
    * Successfully install and configure VMware Workstation/Player on a host machine.
    * Create a new virtual machine instance specifically designated as a Domain Controller.

2.  **Advanced Network Configuration for Virtual Machines:** üåê
    * Configure the Domain Controller virtual machine with two distinct network adapters:
        * One adapter configured for external network access (e.g., NAT or Bridged mode, obtaining IP automatically from the host's network).
        * A second adapter configured for an internal-only private network, facilitating communication with client machines.

3.  **Windows Server 2019 Installation and Baseline Setup:** üíø
    * Perform a clean installation of Windows Server 2019 on the Domain Controller virtual machine.
    * Assign a static IP address to the internal network adapter, ensuring proper network segmentation.
    * Configure the external network adapter to automatically acquire IP addressing via DHCP (from the home router/network).
    * Properly name the server according to best practices.

4.  **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Deployment:** üå≥
    * Install the Active Directory Domain Services role on the Windows Server 2019 instance.
    * Promote the server to a Domain Controller and create a new Active Directory domain.
    * Understand the fundamental components of an Active Directory domain.

5.  **Network Address Translation (NAT) and Routing Configuration:** ‚ÜîÔ∏è
    * Configure NAT and routing services on the Domain Controller to enable client machines on the private internal network to access the internet through the Domain Controller.

6.  **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server Setup:** üè∑Ô∏è
    * Install and configure the DHCP Server role on the Domain Controller.
    * Create a DHCP scope to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server information to client machines.

7.  **Bulk User Provisioning with PowerShell:** üßë‚Äçüíª
    * Develop or utilize an existing PowerShell script to automate the creation of a large number of user accounts (e.g., 1000 users) within Active Directory.
    * Understand the basic principles of scripting for Active Directory management.
